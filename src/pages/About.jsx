        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Department Overview</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The department of Electronics and Communication Engineering has been established in the year 1982 with an intake capacity of 30 seats which progressively increased to 120 seats over a period of time. Apart from the UG course, the department offers Postgraduate Course in Digital Communication and Networking. The department also has a Research Center with state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities for Research activities on Core and Interdisciplinary domains. The department boasts of a team of highly qualified, dedicated, and experienced faculty. In the department, 33% of faculty are doctorates and 33% are pursuing Ph.D from reputed Institutes across the country. E&CE offers a great ambiance for the wholesome development of students.

          With an ever-growing call for quality education and research, the department is committed to excellence in education. It has stringent recruitment policies, high standards for academic performance, outstanding infrastructure, and a proactive placement cell. The students are rigorously trained in their academic curriculum and also in skills that are required for the industry. They are given customized and employability training both in technical as well as in communication skills. The department runs a VLSI training program with SEER Academy, Hyderabad.

          Our students do industry-oriented mini-projects in their pre-final semester using state-of-the-art lab facilities provided in Vinuthana and Intel labs. Through this, they gain experience and exposure to industry practices to become competent and tech-savvy professionals.
